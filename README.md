# Step-by-Step guide to downloading and executing the script:

Open your terminal.

Navigate to the directory where you want to download the script, or just stay in your home directory.

## Use curl to download the script:

  curl -o setup_laravel.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MDALAMIN2526/sh_collection/eee91c17eba3a063fefb200febe68bbb4aad9bbf/setup_laravel.sh

## Make the downloaded script executable:

  chmod +x setup_laravel.sh

## Run the script with superuser privileges:

  sudo ./setup_laravel.sh
This will download the script, make it executable, and then run it to set up your Ubuntu server for hosting a Laravel 10 application with Nginx.
